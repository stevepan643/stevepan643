# Hello!!!
> "Stay hungry, stay foolish." â€” Steve Jobs
- ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Steve Pan.
- ðŸ‘€ Passionate about technology, art, and innovation. Still learning. My idols are Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

## Interests ðŸŒ±

Programming & Tech: Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Rust, and working on some small projects for practice. Iâ€™m developing a game engine right now. Itâ€™s still in the early stages, but Iâ€™m looking forward to gaining more experience and improving quickly.
Philosophy & Freedom: Iâ€™ve always believed that freedom is crucial, especially in thoughts and life. My goal is to live in an environment where I can do what I want freely, without constraints.
Music: I enjoy listening to J-POP and instrumental music, especially melodies that touch the heart. Of course, C-POP is great too, Jay Chou has been a big part of my life since childhood.
Anime: I love watching anime like CLANNAD, Violet Evergarden, Attack on Titan, and DARLING in the FRANXX, among othersâ€”too many to list!

## Current Projects ðŸš§

Developing a game engine using Java, LWJGL, and JOML. Iâ€™m still in the learning phase, but striving to improve.
Learning Rust, hoping to use it for some cool projects in the future and challenge myself!

## Goals ðŸŽ¯

Continuously learn and practice to improve my skills and create meaningful projects.
Hope to get involved in more challenging projects in the future, explore new possibilities, and achieve my dreams.
