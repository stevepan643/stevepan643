Hey! I'm Steve Pan。 
Passionate about technology, art, and innovation. Still learning. My idols are Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

Interests

Programming & Tech: I’m currently learning Java and Rust, and working on some small projects for practice. I’m developing a game engine right now. It’s still in the early stages, but I’m looking forward to gaining more experience and improving quickly.
Philosophy & Freedom: I’ve always believed that freedom is crucial, especially in thoughts and life. My goal is to live in an environment where I can do what I want freely, without constraints.
Music: I enjoy listening to J-POP and instrumental music, especially melodies that touch the heart. Of course, C-POP is great too, Jay Chou has been a big part of my life since childhood.
Anime: I love watching anime like CLANNAD, Violet Evergarden, Attack on Titan, and DARLING in the FRANXX, among others—too many to list!

Current Projects

Developing a game engine using Java, LWJGL, and JOML. I’m still in the learning phase, but striving to improve.
Learning Rust, hoping to use it for some cool projects in the future and challenge myself!

Goals

Continuously learn and practice to improve my skills and create meaningful projects.
Hope to get involved in more challenging projects in the future, explore new possibilities, and achieve my dreams.
